        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My first DSLR camera was a Nikon D5100, a gift to me from my grandmother. I was only 13 at the time, so given that I am 23 now, I have had ample time practice my photography.
        </p>    
        <p>It wasn't until college that I adamently pursued portrait photography, largely in part due to the motivation of my now best friend. At first, it was a casual pastime me and my friends did together, as I could practice my photography and they could get pretty photos. But around my sophomore year of college, I upgraded a lot of my equipment and began doing some commercial work. Now I coordinate and direct higher budget shoots, often times with the same friends that I shot with on top of UCF parking garages.
